Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Prehospital Trauma Triage Strategies
An excel-based decision tree combined with a Markov model to evaluate the short- and long-term impacts of six prehospital trauma triage strategies in the UK. Cost-effectiveness was assessed using probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA), one-way sensitivity analysis, and Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI) to account for uncertainty and guide optimal decision-making.
